# Agentic Development Flow

Use this reference when choosing the daily agentic development mode. Keep the
root prompt concise; this file owns the detailed routing.

## Skill Routing

| Work type | Default route | Output |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Product discovery, demand reality, "is this worth building" | gstack `office-hours` | Product direction or design doc before engineering planning |
| Complex engineering plan, architecture lock-in, cross-module refactor | gstack `plan-eng-review` | Approved execution plan with architecture, data flow, edge cases, and tests |
| UI/UX or design-system plan | gstack `plan-design-review` | Design critique and plan fixes before implementation |
| Small or medium feature/fix plan | Waza `/think` | Concise approved plan, then implementation on request |
| Bug, regression, error, crash, failing test | Waza `/hunt` | Root cause sentence with evidence before any fix |
| Implemented diff, pre-merge, release follow-through | Waza `/check` | Review findings, safe fixes, verification, and shipment state |
| Architecture diagram or system-flow diagram | `diagram-design` | Mermaid or structured diagram artifact grounded in repo context |

## Due Diligence Levels

P1/P2/P3 is the shared due-diligence protocol underneath the routing.

- `P1_GLOBAL_ARCHITECTURE`: identify real boundaries, entrypoints, owners, authoritative files, dependencies, and out-of-scope areas.
- `P2_DATA_FLOW_TRACE`: walk one concrete route through requests, UI events, jobs, config, messages, or database values to the final output.
- `P3_DESIGN_DECISION`: explain why the current shape exists, which invariant must stay true, and why the chosen change is the smallest coherent one.

For small tasks, keep P1/P2/P3 internal and report only the result. For
`plan-eng-review`, `/hunt`, risky refactors, deployments, auth/payment/data
work, or shared contracts, report the P1/P2/P3 evidence explicitly.

## Daily Flow

1. Route the request by intent before reading broadly.
2. Read the repo-local contract first: `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/lessons.md`, and `.ai/harness/policy.json`.
3. Use the selected skill or mode to produce either an approved plan, a root cause, or a review verdict.
4. Convert approved complex plans to execution with `scripts/plan-to-todo.sh --plan <plan>`. Contract-level plans are projected into a linked `codex/<slug>` worktree when the policy enables it.
5. After substantive changes, run project checks and record evidence in `tasks/`. For contract worktrees, run Waza `/check` before `scripts/contract-worktree.sh finish`.

## Boundaries

- Do not route large architecture decisions through Waza `/think` by default.
- Do not use gstack plan review for routine local edits where `/think` or direct execution is enough.
- Hooks may emit advisory Waza `/check` and `/health` route hints on prompt submit, but must not block, mutate files, or auto-run skills based on semantic intent.
- Keep `office-hours` for product-demand shaping; use `plan-eng-review` when engineering execution needs to be locked.
