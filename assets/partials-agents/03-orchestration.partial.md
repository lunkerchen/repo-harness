## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Research Before Planning
- Deeply inspect relevant code and persist findings in `tasks/research.md`.
- Avoid implementation before research, spec, plan, and contract are complete.

### 2. Annotation Cycle
- Keep active plans in `plans/plan-*.md` and iterate with inline notes.
- Treat the latest non-archived plan file as the active plan.
- Resolve annotations before implementation.

### 3. Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for non-trivial tasks.
- If `docs/spec.md` is missing, run `bash scripts/new-spec.sh` first.
- If no active plan exists, run `bash scripts/new-sprint.sh --slug <slug> --title <title>` before implementation.
- Keep active checklist items in `tasks/todo.md`.

### 4. Subagent Strategy
- Offload independent tracks to focused subagents.
- Parallelize only non-dependent paths.
- For broad research, logs, and repo archaeology, use subagents or sidecar `codex exec --json`; write conclusions to `tasks/research.md`.

### 4b. Context Budget
- Treat auto-compact as an unreliable fallback.
- At orange/red context pressure, refresh `.ai/harness/handoff/current.md` and `.ai/harness/handoff/resume.md`, then resume from a fresh session.

### 5. Self-Improvement Loop
- After correction, append prevention rule to `tasks/lessons.md`.

### 6. Verification Before Done
- No completion without verification evidence.

### 6b. Contract Verification
- Use task contracts in `tasks/contracts/` as completion gates.
- Use implementation notes in `tasks/notes/` for task-local decisions that should not automatically become memory.
- Validate exit criteria and review recommendation before any done/completed response.

### 7. Balanced Elegance
- Redesign hacky non-trivial fixes before shipping.

### 8. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- Start fixes when logs/errors/tests are sufficient.
