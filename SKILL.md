# repo-harness

`repo-harness` is the repo-local agentic development harness skill, formerly `repo-harness-skill`.
It is a thin router over a versioned workflow engine.

Compatibility boundary:

- internal engine: tasks-first harness
- contract ID: tasks-first-harness-v1
- compatibility alias: `repo-harness-skill`
- retired install aliases: `project-initializer` under `~/.codex/skills` and `~/.claude/skills`

The skill should not carry the whole workflow contract in prose. It should:

1. inspect the repository
2. classify the workflow state
3. choose the correct path
4. rely on the repo contract, migration scripts, and tests for enforcement

## When to use

- initialize a new repo with Codex/Codex-compatible workflow scaffolding
- migrate an older repo to the current tasks-first harness
- audit drift between prompts, hooks, scripts, and repo-local contract files
- repair broken task-sync, workflow-contract, or handoff surfaces

## When not to use

- runtime bug debugging inside an already healthy AI workflow
- generic project scaffolding unrelated to AI routing or repo-local workflow contracts
- ordinary product feature work

## Router Protocol

Always start with structured inspection, not prompt guessing.

### Step 1. Inspect first

Run:

- `bun scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo <path> --format text`
  - fallback: `node --experimental-strip-types scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo <path> --format text`

Read the result fields:

- `mode`
- `legacy_contract_version`
- `drift_signals`
- `required_decisions`
- `safe_defaults`

### Step 2. Choose one path

1. **Initialize**
   - use when the repo has no meaningful tasks-first workflow yet
2. **Migrate**
   - use when the repo has legacy workflow docs, missing contract manifest, or stale harness artifacts
3. **Audit**
   - use when the repo mostly works but the user wants drift analysis and enforcement review
4. **Repair**
   - use when the repo has a current contract surface but broken task-sync, hooks, or handoff behavior
### Step 3. Prefer engine actions over prompt-only fixes

Default order:

1. migrate legacy docs if needed
2. install or refresh workflow contract artifacts
3. sync hooks, helpers, and templates
4. merge the guidance-only `external_tooling` profile into `.ai/harness/policy.json`
5. verify the repo-local contract

Do not treat hooks as the primary source of truth. The repo contract lives in repo files.

## Core Engine Surfaces

The single machine-readable contract source is:

- `assets/workflow-contract.v1.json`

The installed runtime copy inside a repo is:

- `.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json`

The main engine entrypoints are:

- `scripts/inspect-project-state.ts`
- `scripts/migrate-workflow-docs.ts`
- `scripts/migrate-project-template.sh`
- `scripts/check-agent-tooling.sh`
- `scripts/check-task-workflow.sh`
- `scripts/create-project-dirs.sh`

## Action Command Surface

The public command skills live in `assets/skill-commands/` as thin facades over
the same engine. Use action-style names for discoverability:

- `repo-harness-plan`: interactive planning; no repo mutation by default
- `repo-harness-review`: plan review across product, engineering, design, and DevEx
- `repo-harness-autoplan`: automatic plan -> review -> decision summary pipeline
- `repo-harness-init`: install or refresh the harness in an existing repo
- `repo-harness-scaffold`: create a new project or module scaffold, then attach the harness
- `repo-harness-migrate`: migrate legacy workflow docs and stale harness artifacts
- `repo-harness-upgrade`: refresh an installed harness through manifest-owned upgrade actions
- `repo-harness-capability`: add selected capability boundaries without running full init/migrate/upgrade
- `repo-harness-architecture`: resolve architecture drift requests and update docs or diagrams without harness refresh
- `repo-harness-handoff`: prepare or resume Codex handoff packets for long-task rollover
- `repo-harness-deploy`: check deploy and private operations configuration without publishing or deploying
- `repo-harness-repair`: repair broken task sync, hook routing, handoff, context, policy, or helpers
- `repo-harness-check`: run verification gates and report release or pre-merge readiness

Internal steps such as `hooks-init`, `docs-init`, and `create-project-dirs` are
not public commands. They stay behind `init`, `scaffold`, `migrate`, and
`upgrade` so users choose intent instead of implementation details.

## Plan Index

The router should still respect the canonical plan catalog in `assets/plan-map.json`:

Core Plans (A-F):
- Plan A: Remix
- Plan B: UmiJS + Ant Design Pro
- Plan C: Vite + TanStack Router
- Plan D: Bun + Turborepo
- Plan E: Astro landing page
- Plan F: Expo + NativeWind

Custom Presets (G-K):
- Plan G: AI quantitative trading
- Plan H: Financial trading / FIX / RFQ
- Plan I: Web3 DApp
- Plan J: AI coding agent / TUI
- Plan K: Fully custom configuration

## AI-native scaffold overlay

`repo-harness-scaffold` keeps A-K as the project-type catalog and uses
`ai_native_profile` as a separate overlay axis. The default profile is `none`,
so existing generated output stays on the selected A-K plan. Use an overlay only
when the generated app needs agent runtime, UI protocol, tool, sidecar, state,
or observability boundaries.

Supported profile IDs live in `assets/initializer-question-pack.v4.json`.
Generated structure overlays currently exist for:

- `runtime-console`: Vite 8 + assistant-ui, AG-UI event transport, Bun/Hono
  agent gateway, run store, contracts, approvals, artifacts, and telemetry
- `product-copilot`: in-product copilot panel, AG-UI app-domain events, product
  context loaders, business action tools, authorization and approval policies
- `sidecar-kernel`: Bun/Hono app gateway with Python, Go, or Rust kernels behind
  MCP tools or narrow HTTP jobs

Do not turn the AI-native overlay into another lettered plan. Do not make A2UI,
Python, Go, Rust, Redis, ClickHouse, Temporal, object storage, vector DBs, model
providers, or tracing vendors mandatory defaults.

## Migration Rules

For legacy repos, migrate old document surfaces before refreshing templates.

Legacy paths include:

- `docs/plan.md`
- `docs/TODO.md`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`
- `docs/contract.md`
- `docs/review.md`
- `docs/handoff.md`
- `HANDOFF.md`

Use:

- `bun scripts/migrate-workflow-docs.ts --repo <path> --dry-run`
- `bun scripts/migrate-workflow-docs.ts --repo <path> --apply`

Migration defaults:

- preserve user-authored content
- archive uncertain legacy content instead of guessing
- remove repo-local Skill Factory and auto-memory surfaces when present
- archive legacy `docs/PROGRESS.md` content; do not regenerate it as a default workflow surface
- keep `tasks/todo.md` limited to deferred medium/long-term goals, including the tradeoff and revisit trigger
- move hidden contracts and deep findings into `tasks/research.md`
- distill repeated corrections into `tasks/lessons.md`
- merge missing `external_tooling` defaults into `.ai/harness/policy.json` without overwriting explicit user values
- keep gstack/gbrain/CodeGraph detection advisory-only; do not auto-install, auto-upgrade, auto-sync, or auto-enable MCP
- let `repo-harness init` bootstrap required Codex/Claude runtime skills in one pass: Waza (`check`, `design`, `health`, `hunt`, `learn`, `read`, `think`, `write`) plus `diagram-design` when a source copy exists
- treat Waza as Codex-first: `~/.codex/skills` is the Codex runtime source, `~/.agents/skills` is only skills CLI staging/cache, and updates require stage -> copy to Codex -> `cmp` verification

## Repo-Local Contract

Preserve these semantics:

- `plans/` is the timestamped plan catalog; `.ai/harness/active-plan` selects the active plan, with `.claude/.active-plan` as a legacy fallback during transition
- `plans/plan-*.md` must carry a workflow inventory before implementation: active plan, owning worktree, contract, review, notes, deferred ledger, checks, run snapshots, scope owner, switching rule, and worktree isolation path
- `tasks/todo.md` is the deferred-goal ledger; active execution stays in the plan's `## Task Breakdown`
- `tasks/lessons.md` stores correction-derived rules
- `tasks/research.md` stores deep repo findings and hidden contracts
- `tasks/contracts/` and `tasks/reviews/` are completion gates
- `tasks/contracts/*.contract.md` must repeat the workflow inventory and make `allowed_paths` the edit-scope authority
- `tasks/workstreams/` stores durable capability progress
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` stores release history
- `.ai/hooks/` is the shared hook source of truth
- `.claude/settings.json` is the Claude adapter surface; `.codex/hooks.json` is the Codex adapter surface; repo-local `.claude/hooks/` is not generated by default

## Hook Workflow Protocol

When the task mentions hooks, hook workflow, Codex hook detection, or hook-based
automation, treat it as a runtime-harness slice, not a generic config edit.

Map the route first:

1. `assets/hooks/` is the installable source.
2. `.ai/hooks/` is the repo-local implementation.
3. `.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json` are adapters that dispatch to
   `.ai/hooks/run-hook.sh`.
4. Codex also requires the repo hook to be trusted in Codex Settings before it
   executes.
5. Generated `.claude/hooks/` shims are legacy cleanup targets; preserve only
   user-authored `custom-*.sh` hooks.

Trace one real event before changing behavior, for example:

`UserPromptSubmit -> adapter -> .ai/hooks/run-hook.sh -> prompt-guard.sh -> plan
or advisory output`

or:

`PostToolUse(Edit|Write) -> adapter -> .ai/hooks/run-hook.sh ->
post-edit-guard.sh -> architecture drift, brain sync, contract verification,
task handoff`

For Codex hook failures, debug in this order: `.codex/hooks.json`, Codex Settings
trust, `.ai/hooks/run-hook.sh`, the target hook script, then `.ai/harness/events.jsonl`
or `.claude/.trace.jsonl` evidence.

Hooks are accelerators and guards. They do not replace `plans/`, `tasks/`,
contracts, reviews, policy, checks, or handoff artifacts. Heavy workflows such as
autoresearch must not silently run as background hook mutations. A hook may detect
optimization intent, point to an existing `autoresearch-*/session.json`, or remind
the agent to record an experiment; the agent still owns baseline measurement,
candidate staging, scoring, and winner promotion.
Keep local autoresearch run products under ignored `autoresearch/` when they
must remain in the workspace.
`autoresearch-advisory.sh` is a self-host maintainer hook for this repo, not a
default installable user hook.

Verify hook workflow changes with hook-specific evidence:

- default hook asset parity between `assets/hooks/` and `.ai/hooks/`, with
  explicit exclusions only for self-host maintainer hooks
- `bun test tests/hook-runtime.test.ts tests/workflow-contract.test.ts`
- `bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh`
- `bash scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict`
- `bun scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo . --format text`
- `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, `.ai/harness/events.jsonl`, or handoff readback

## Output Ownership

This skill may create or update:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `.ai/hooks/*`
- `.claude/settings.json`
- `.codex/hooks.json`
- `.claude/templates/*`
- `docs/spec.md`
- `docs/reference-configs/*.md`
- `tasks/todo.md`
- `tasks/lessons.md`
- `tasks/research.md`
- `tasks/contracts/*`
- `tasks/reviews/*`
- `tasks/workstreams/*`
- `deploy/README.md`
- `deploy/sql/*` for ordered deployment SQL files
- `.ai/harness/*`
- helper scripts under `scripts/`

## Verification

When changing the engine, migration path, contract manifest, or self-hosted workflow, run:

```bash
bun test
bash scripts/check-deploy-sql-order.sh
bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh
bash scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict
bash scripts/migrate-project-template.sh --repo . --dry-run
```

For migration-focused work, also inspect and dry-run legacy doc migration explicitly:

```bash
bun scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo . --format text
bun scripts/migrate-workflow-docs.ts --repo . --dry-run
```

## Iteration Notes

- Keep this file short; detailed policy belongs in `docs/reference-configs/`
- Keep stack-specific detail in assets and references, not in this skill body
- If the router changes, update `evals/evals.json`
- If the contract changes, update templates, migration, checks, and tests together
