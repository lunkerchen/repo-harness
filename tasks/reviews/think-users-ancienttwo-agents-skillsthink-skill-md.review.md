## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: Waza `/check` ship review for a contract-level runtime-harness hook gate.
- P1 map: Entry is `UserPromptSubmit -> .ai/hooks/prompt-guard.sh`; shared state and parser live in `.ai/hooks/lib/workflow-state.sh` and mirrored `assets/hooks/lib/workflow-state.sh`; final merge path is `scripts/contract-worktree.sh finish`; structured evidence writer is `scripts/verify-sprint.sh`; generated repo parity lives in `assets/templates/helpers/*`, `assets/templates/review.template.md`, `scripts/lib/project-init-lib.sh`, and reference docs.
- P2 trace: Review/release prompt emits Waza `/check` plus `[ExternalAcceptance]`; the main agent runs the peer command and pastes `## External Acceptance Advice` into `tasks/reviews/<slug>.review.md`; done intent calls `workflow_external_acceptance_status`; `contract-worktree.sh finish` checks the same parser before `verify-sprint.sh`; `verify-sprint.sh` records `external_acceptance` status/source/reviewer/message in `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`.
- P3 decision: Hooks still do not execute peer CLIs. The change gates on recorded review-file evidence only, preserving quiet Codex non-SessionStart stdout and avoiding network/auth work in hook hot paths.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: current Codex review pass plus external Claude acceptance.
- Commands run:
  - `bun test tests/workflow-state-lib.test.ts tests/hook-runtime.test.ts tests/helper-scripts.test.ts tests/hook-contracts.test.ts tests/bootstrap-files.test.ts` -> pass, 155 pass.
  - `claude -p ... --output-format text --no-session-persistence --max-budget-usd 1` -> external acceptance pass.
- Manual checks:
  - Confirmed `.ai/hooks` changes mirror `assets/hooks`.
  - Confirmed `scripts/*` helper changes mirror `assets/templates/helpers/*`.
  - Confirmed generated review templates now include `## External Acceptance Advice`.
- Supporting artifacts:
  - `tasks/notes/think-users-ancienttwo-agents-skillsthink-skill-md.notes.md`
  - `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes.
- Run snapshot: not generated in this slice.

## External Acceptance Advice

> **External Acceptance**: pass
> **External Reviewer**: Claude
> **External Source**: claude-review
> **External Started**: 2026-05-30T02:06:00+0800
> **External Completed**: 2026-05-30T02:07:00+0800

- P1 blockers: none
- P2 advisories:
  - Empty external acceptance fields currently fail through downstream reviewer/source mismatch instead of a dedicated "missing field" diagnostic.
  - `contract-worktree.sh finish` and `verify-sprint.sh` intentionally degrade when an old `workflow-state.sh` lacks the parser functions; release notes should mention that updating the shared workflow-state helper enables the gate.
  - Generated review templates start with `External Acceptance: unavailable`, which is correct but requires agents to fill the section before done/finish can pass.
- Acceptance checklist: pass

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Review/release prompts now emit a host-aware external acceptance prompt in addition to the existing Waza `/check` routing and debug `[CrossReview]` advisory.
- Done/finish gates require either `External Acceptance: pass` from the opposite reviewer/source or a concrete `Manual Override:` line.
- `verify-sprint.sh` preserves the review file as authority and only mirrors parsed external acceptance state into checks JSON.
- Host inference now recognizes Codex shell/session environment (`CODEX_THREAD_ID`, `CODEX_SHELL`, `CODEX_INTERNAL_ORIGINATOR_OVERRIDE`) when `HOOK_HOST` is absent.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- No P1 blockers.
- P2 diagnostic polish can tighten missing-field messages later without changing gate semantics.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | Parser, prompt, done gate, finish gate, verify-sprint JSON, and tests are covered. |
| Product depth | 8/10 | Keeps peer execution out of hooks while making acceptance mandatory at completion. |
| Design quality | 8/10 | Reuses review file as authority and shared workflow-state helpers. |
| Code quality | 8/10 | Shell parsing is fixed-shape and mirrored; remaining polish is diagnostic specificity. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test tests/workflow-state-lib.test.ts tests/hook-runtime.test.ts tests/helper-scripts.test.ts tests/hook-contracts.test.ts tests/bootstrap-files.test.ts`
- Re-check final integration on `main` with root required checks before push.

## Summary

- Pass. The branch implements host-aware external acceptance evidence without moving peer execution into hooks.
