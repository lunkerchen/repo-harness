This file is a tracked mainline snapshot derived from repo artifacts. It is not a live lock, not a kanban board, and not an implementation gate. If it is stale, read the source artifacts below.

## Current Focus

- Status: ManualClearedWithActiveWork
- Active Plan: (none)
- Plan Status: (none)
- Next Task: inspect active worktree marker(s)
- Clear Note: Manual clear requested, but active work markers still exist. Idle was not written.

## Mainline Snapshot Reading

- Current worktree: `tasks/current.md`
- Target branch snapshot: `git show main:tasks/current.md`
- Rule: non-target worktrees may read the target branch snapshot, but must verify against source artifacts before acting.
