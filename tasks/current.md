This file is a tracked mainline snapshot derived from repo artifacts. It is not a live lock, not a kanban board, and not an implementation gate. If it is stale, read the source artifacts below.

## Current Focus

- Status: Idle
- Active Plan: (none)
- Plan Status: (none)
- Next Task: (none)
- Clear Note: (none)

## Mainline Snapshot Reading

- Current worktree: `tasks/current.md`
- Target branch snapshot: `git show main:tasks/current.md`
- Rule: non-target worktrees may read the target branch snapshot, but must verify against source artifacts before acting.

## Active Work

- (none)
## Workstreams

- `tasks/workstreams/workflow-engine/contract-assets/cleanup-script-policy.md`: status=completed, current_slice=todo-01, source_plan=(none)
## Handoff

- Exact Next Step: External acceptance is manual_override; expected pass from Codex via codex-review. Run external acceptance via codex-review and record ## External Acceptance Advice in tasks/reviews/20260601-0139-tgz-pick-wt.review.md. Command: /check

## Checks

- status=pass, source=verify-sprint, exit_code=0, file=.ai/harness/checks/latest.json

## Git Status

- Summary: 15 changed/untracked path(s)
