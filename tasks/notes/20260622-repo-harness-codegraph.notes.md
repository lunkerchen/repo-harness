# 20260622 repo-harness CodeGraph general repo access notes

## Slice

Sprint 0 contract freeze for `plans/sprints/20260622-repo-harness-codegraph-sprint-plan.md`.

## Decisions

- Do not change the production MCP reader in this slice. Its legacy deny globs,
  `.gitignore` handling, hidden-file defaults, and redaction behavior are known
  conflicts with the new PRD and belong to Sprint 1 after the contract is
  frozen.
- Add a versioned schema and a CI contract test before adding runtime adapter
  code. This keeps Sprint 0 reviewable and prevents a partial implementation
  from accidentally widening access without manifest parity.
- Treat CodeGraph 1.0.1 as the indexed metadata/search backend, not the manifest
  source of truth. Local CLI evidence does not expose complete repo inventory,
  stable snapshot handles, file hashes, or mutation APIs.

## Tradeoffs

- The S0 test uses a local fake CodeGraph inventory in the test file instead of
  adding a production adapter abstraction. This avoids committing an interface
  before Sprint 1/S2 implementation pressure is clearer.
- The tracked fixture uses ordinary text files for portability; the CI contract
  test materializes empty, large, binary, internal symlink, external symlink, and
  symlink-chain cases at runtime. Race/fault cases remain Sprint 1/S2/S3 test
  work because they require the production guard and mutation planes.

## Open Follow-up

- Sprint 1 must replace legacy MCP reader filtering with the general repo
  Registry, Path Guard, and `.ignore` policy rather than layering the new API on
  top of current `COMMON_DENY_GLOBS`.

## Sprint 1 Runtime Notes

- The first runtime slice adds a separate general repo access service rather
  than changing `WorkspaceManager` in place. The older workspace tools keep
  their compatibility behavior; the new `repo_id` tools implement the PRD
  contract.
- `repo_manifest` is walker-backed in this slice and marks entries
  `indexed:false`. CodeGraph metadata merge, real index revisions, shared
  snapshot lifecycle, and cache/performance work remain Sprint 2.
- Reads open the canonical in-repo target after path and symlink checks. This
  reduces symlink-swap exposure with the Node filesystem APIs available here,
  but a stronger fd-relative/openat design still belongs in the S2/S4 security
  pass if the runtime grows native bindings.

## Sprint 2 Adapter/Snapshot Notes

- The CodeGraph integration is a bounded CLI adapter over
  `codegraph files --format flat --json`. Its output is treated as indexed
  metadata only. Secure filesystem walking remains the manifest source of truth
  because the Sprint 0 spike proved CodeGraph inventory is not a complete repo
  file list.
- Every CodeGraph-returned path is normalized, resolved under the canonical repo
  root, and checked against `.ignore` before metadata is merged. Returned paths
  that are ignored, missing, directories, or outside the repo increment
  `codegraph.filtered_paths` instead of widening access.
- `snapshot_id` is deterministic from repo identity, registry revision,
  `.ignore` digest, CodeGraph revision, and the manifest digest. A caller-provided
  stale `snapshot_id` returns `SNAPSHOT_STALE` rather than silently mixing
  manifest/search/read versions.
- `.ai/harness/mcp/audit.log` is not included in the snapshot revision digest.
  The audit file remains visible according to `.ignore`; the exclusion is only
  to prevent the reader's own append-only audit side effect from invalidating the
  snapshot it just returned.
- CodeGraph CLI `query` is symbol search, not complete repo full-text search.
  `search_text` therefore keeps the policy-consistent filesystem fallback while
  surfacing whether each matched file is present in CodeGraph indexed metadata.

## Sprint 2 Snapshot Cache/Index-Lag Notes

- Snapshot TTL is currently a bounded in-process memoization contract:
  5 minutes, at most 16 snapshots. The cache key includes repo id, registry
  revision, `.ignore` digest, and the validated snapshot id. A hit is only
  reported after the reader recomputes the current manifest digest and confirms
  the snapshot id still matches; this preserves stale detection for file,
  registry, and `.ignore` changes.
- `snapshot_state` is `ready` when the filesystem-backed snapshot can be served,
  and `index_lagging` when CodeGraph metadata proves the index is behind the
  filesystem. Secure walker traversal errors remain represented by the existing
  `partial` and `walker_errors` fields, because a partial manifest can still be
  served with explicit completeness metadata. CodeGraph lag evidence is limited
  to stale indexed paths that no longer resolve and indexed files whose
  CodeGraph size differs from the current filesystem size.
- This slice does not claim the full S2 performance target. Manifest generation
  still walks the complete visible tree to compute counts, hashes, and the
  manifest digest. The remaining performance slice must measure 10k/100k/500k
  fixtures and decide whether to introduce a true streaming inventory structure.

## Sprint 2 Cache-Key/Performance Notes

- Public `snapshot_cache.key` is now scoped by tool and repo-relative path set;
  `snapshot_cache.snapshot_key` names the underlying repo snapshot. This keeps
  `repo_manifest`, `stat_file`, `read_file`, `read_files`, `list_tree`, and
  `search_text` from presenting a single repo-wide cache key for path-specific
  work.
- Entry metadata has a bounded in-process cache keyed by repo id, registry
  revision, `.ignore` digest, repo-relative path, and the current stat
  signature. Warm snapshot revalidation can reuse unchanged metadata without
  re-hashing and binary-probing every unchanged file. File changes, `.ignore`
  changes, and registry revision changes produce different cache keys.
- `docs/researches/20260623-general-repo-reader-performance-baseline.md`
  records the first reproducible baseline. The 10k fixture completed with a
  warm manifest first page at 76.37 ms and warm search at 499.84 ms. The 100k
  fixture completed without OOM, returned paginated results, and met the
  warm-path SLO: manifest 733.76 ms, read first chunk 0.74 ms, and search
  779.04 ms.
- The walker optimization removes the per-entry `resolveRepoPath` hot path for
  manifest traversal and constructs metadata directly from the directory entry
  and one `lstat`. Explicit `snapshot_id` stat/read calls can reuse a cached
  snapshot and validate the requested file hash instead of rebuilding the full
  repo snapshot. This preserves stale detection for the requested file while
  removing whole-repo revalidation from ordinary warm read chunks.
- `repo_manifest` now uses a streaming page builder: it walks the visible tree
  to prove counts and a metadata-revision digest, but retains only the requested
  page entries. The current page still carries exact content hashes; non-page
  file content metadata is counted as `content_deferred` and is computed when a
  later page, `stat_file`, `read_file`, or `search_text` actually returns
  content.
- Metadata-only traversals no longer populate the bounded entry metadata cache.
  This avoids 500k sequential cache-thrash when the visible entry count exceeds
  the 200k cache cap; exact content metadata remains cached for returned page
  entries and read/stat paths.
- The 500k fixture now completes: manifest 12201.90 ms warm first page, read
  first chunk 3.67 ms, warm search 12668.28 ms, with
  `counts.content_deferred=499010`. This records the Sprint 2 baseline and
  leaves 500k latency as a future optimization target rather than an open S2
  checklist item.
