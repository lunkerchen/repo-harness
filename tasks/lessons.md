## Entries
- Date: 2026-06-12
- Triggered by correction: a freshly captured Approved program-level plan (architecture-doc-truth-loop) grabbed `.ai/harness/active-plan` in the shared primary tree; a concurrent session's verification-blocker cleanup saw "Approved active plan without task contract", projected it to todo, and archived plan+todo within minutes
- Mistake pattern: letting a program-layer artifact (sprint-shaped plan that never gets its own contract) occupy the active-plan slot, which the harness reserves for contract-backed execution plans; concurrent sessions then legitimately reconcile it away
- Prevention rule: capture program-level plans with `capture-plan.sh --no-active` (sprint stays the program authority; only slice plans captured via `sprint-backlog.sh start-task` take the marker), and treat any Approved plan holding the marker without a contract as a state error, not a parking position
- Where to apply next time: any program/umbrella plan capture, multi-session days with open contract worktrees, and the arch-doc-loop sprint slices themselves

- Date: 2026-06-10
- Triggered by correction: hook tests flaked at bun's 5s default per-test timeout during parallel sessions; the prior workaround was rerunning with `--timeout 20000`
- Mistake pattern: blaming prompt-guard.sh source size for slow startup without profiling; measured bash parse is ~12ms and the TS engine spawn ~35ms, while the real cost is hundreds of small fork/execs per invocation (~0.25s warm, >2s under load) multiplied by 4-6 hook invocations per test
- Prevention rule: test files whose every test spawns hook shell scripts end-to-end set a file-level `setDefaultTimeout(20000)`; reserve per-test timeout annotations for files where only a few tests are slow, and do not refactor hook startup paths for speed without a phase-probe measurement first
- Where to apply next time: `tests/hook-runtime.test.ts`, `tests/hook-protocol.test.ts`, and any new test file that exercises `.ai/hooks/*.sh` via spawnSync

- Date: 2026-05-28
- Triggered by correction: after structured plan capture was fixed, plain “开发新功能” prompts still only emitted BDD guidance and did not create a file-backed plan
- Mistake pattern: treating new-feature prose as advisory-only because it lacked `$think` or an approved-plan body
- Prevention rule: ordinary feature-building prompts should create Draft `plans/` artifacts, but must not project `tasks/todo.md` until a concrete plan is approved
- Where to apply next time: `prompt-guard.sh` plan-start classifiers and hook runtime tests

- Date: 2026-05-27
- Triggered by correction: structured prompt capture appeared to keep using old hook behavior during feature-development prompts
- Mistake pattern: setting `HOOK_REPO_ROOT` without making it the process cwd, then relying on repo-relative helper paths inside hook scripts
- Prevention rule: shared hook dispatchers must `cd` into the resolved repo root before executing hook implementations; tests should invoke dispatch from a different cwd
- Where to apply next time: `.ai/hooks/run-hook.sh`, generated hook assets, and any adapter that calls repo-local helper scripts by relative path

- Date: 2026-05-27
- Triggered by correction: a generated plan pasted as pure Markdown should be executable without a magic `PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN:` prefix, while a question about whether it triggers must stay read-only
- Mistake pattern: treating only command-prefixed plans as approved-plan capture candidates and ignoring the plan-shaped Markdown contract users already paste between tools
- Prevention rule: distinguish pure plan-shaped Markdown from meta trigger questions by first nonblank line and section structure; capture the former, never execute the latter
- Where to apply next time: `prompt-guard.sh` intent classifiers and hook runtime tests

- Date: 2026-05-27
- Triggered by correction: an older Draft plan was treated as a global implementation lock even though independent tasks should route through new plans or contract worktrees
- Mistake pattern: using `get_active_plan` fallback-to-latest as ownership truth for every new planning prompt
- Prevention rule: explicit planning prompts must be able to create an independent `plans/plan-*.md`; approval prompts with a full plan body should capture/project that exact body instead of relying on stale active-plan inference
- Where to apply next time: `prompt-guard.sh`, `ensure-task-workflow.sh`, and approval/capture tests

- Date: 2026-05-27
- Triggered by correction: `$think`/plan-start hook did not create a Draft plan when the hook prompt also contained expanded skill instructions with `fix`, `bug`, or `error` wording
- Mistake pattern: running semantic intent greps over the entire host prompt, including injected skill/context blocks, instead of the user's original request text
- Prevention rule: hook intent classifiers must strip injected context blocks before matching plan, implementation, done, or Waza route intent
- Where to apply next time: `prompt-guard.sh`, generated hook assets, and any future host adapter that receives expanded tool/skill context

- Date: 2026-05-28
- Triggered by correction: after the user approved an execution-ready `/think` plan, the assistant stopped at the skill's generic approval footer instead of implementing the already-requested slice
- Mistake pattern: treating "批准" as a pause command even when the surrounding task explicitly said "你来执行" and the repo workflow had a concrete implementation plan
- Prevention rule: once a decision-complete plan is approved for a user-requested execution task, proceed to implementation; only stop for real repo drift, missing permissions, or unsafe external state
- Where to apply next time: `/think` follow-through, plan approval handling, and active-plan execution workflow

- Date: 2026-04-19
- Triggered by correction: repo-local hook defaults had drifted back toward generating `.claude/hooks` shims even though the adapter already dispatches directly into `.ai/hooks/run-hook.sh`
- Mistake pattern: preserving a second repo-local hook path after the authoritative hook layer is already clear
- Prevention rule: for repo-local scaffolding, keep `.ai/hooks/` as the only generated hook implementation layer and reserve `.claude/*` for adapter config plus explicit user-owned overrides only
- Where to apply next time: project bootstrap, migration scripts, hook docs, parity tests, and any cleanup that claims to remove compatibility debt

- Date: 2026-04-08
- Triggered by correction: workflow helper inventories and required-path checks had started drifting across multiple shell scripts
- Mistake pattern: repeating contract-critical lists in more than one place
- Prevention rule: promote helper/file/dir inventories into `assets/workflow-contract.v1.json`, then make scripts and tests consume that contract
- Where to apply next time: any new repo-local workflow artifact, helper script, or migration rule

- Date: 2026-04-08
- Triggered by correction: inspection and migration logic missed initialized repos with bundled Skill Factory assets and partial repos with an old `tasks/todo.md`
- Mistake pattern: classifying repo mode from optional feature presence instead of the primary workflow surface, and only testing clean-slate migrations
- Prevention rule: make repo-state routing prefer core workflow surfaces over optional sidecars, and keep fixture coverage for partially migrated repos with legacy content already in canonical paths
- Where to apply next time: any new repo classifier, migration path, or self-hosted routing script
