# repo-harness ChatGPT Browser Engine

`repo-harness chatgpt browser-*` uses a locally authenticated ChatGPT Web browser session for planning and review workflows. It does not use the OpenAI API and does not require `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## What It Does

- Builds a policy-checked prompt bundle from explicit repo files.
- Saves repo-local session records under `.ai/harness/chatgpt/sessions/<sessionId>/`.
- Supports dry-run preview without opening a browser.
- Supports an Oracle provider wrapper for `oracle --engine browser` (the default, recommended main path).
- Supports linked follow-up sessions, conversation URL readback, and safe cleanup planning.
- Exposes optional MCP tools only when the MCP server is started with `--enable-chatgpt-browser`.

## What It Does Not Do

- It does not ask for usernames, passwords, SSO secrets, 2FA codes, cookies, or browser tokens.
- It does not upload arbitrary repo files.
- It does not enable remote CDP by default.
- It does not treat ChatGPT Web as the source of truth; the repo-local session store is the audit record.
- It does not import local artifact paths from ordinary provider stdout.
- It does not auto-fall back from Oracle to another provider. Oracle may have already submitted the prompt before a capture drop, so silent retries would double-ask.

## Provider Posture

- **`oracle` — default main path.** Oracle owns the browser engine; repo-harness always passes `--engine browser --browser-manual-login`. This is the recommended provider.
- **`native` — deprecated.** The homegrown Chrome CDP engine is no longer maintained and is kept only as a short-term diagnostic entry (`browser-doctor --provider native`). It will be removed. Chrome 136+ also blocks remote-debugging switches against the *default* Chrome data directory (custom `--user-data-dir` still works), but the deprecation is a maintenance decision, not a Chrome limitation.
- **`bridge` — experimental, explicit-only.** The localhost Chrome-extension bridge is not a fallback yet; it still derives completion from a DOM heuristic. Select it explicitly only. It now requires a per-binding capability token and has a server-side backstop (see below).

## First-Time Setup

```bash
repo-harness chatgpt browser-setup --repo .
repo-harness chatgpt browser-doctor --repo .
```

`browser-setup` creates the session root and prints recommended ignore rules for local browser state. Browser profile and token files should remain local.

For an existing signed-in Chrome profile, use the product-scoped bridge:

```bash
repo-harness chatgpt browser-setup \
  --repo . \
  --profile-dir "<user-selected-chrome-profile-dir>" \
  --browser-channel chrome
repo-harness chatgpt browser-bind --repo . --open
repo-harness chatgpt browser-doctor --repo . --provider bridge --json
```

`browser-setup` records only product binding metadata in `.repo-harness/chatgpt-browser.local.json`; it does not copy cookies, tokens, passwords, or browser storage. `browser-bind` then serves a local `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` authorization page and writes an unpacked Chrome extension under `.ai/harness/chatgpt/bridge-extension/`. The page guides the user to open Chrome Extensions, enable **Developer mode**, click **Load unpacked**, select that extension directory, open or refresh ChatGPT, then click **Bind ChatGPT**. The **Bind ChatGPT** button validates a heartbeat from that extension. If ChatGPT is not logged in or the composer is missing, the page tells the user to open ChatGPT, sign in, and bind again. After authorization succeeds, stop the `browser-bind` command before running `browser-consult --provider bridge` because both use the same local bridge port.

If the user selects a Chrome profile subdirectory such as `<chrome-user-data-dir>/<profile-name>`, repo-harness stores the parent user data directory and launches Chrome with `--profile-directory <profile-name>`. On macOS this may look like `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile 1`; Windows and Linux use their own Chrome profile roots. If the user selects the user data directory itself, pass `--profile-directory <name>` explicitly.

Do not use the default Chrome data directory for native CDP validation. Chrome 136+ no longer honors remote-debugging switches against the current user's default Chrome data directory; it requires a non-standard `--user-data-dir`. Existing signed-in real Chrome profiles should use the bridge provider instead of native CDP.

## Dry Run

```bash
repo-harness chatgpt browser-consult \
  --repo . \
  --dry-run \
  --prompt "Review this sprint." \
  --file plans/sprints/example.sprint.md \
  --model "GPT-5.5 Pro" \
  --thinking heavy
```

Dry run validates the prompt, file policy, inline size, and session write path. It saves a `dry_run` session and does not open ChatGPT.

## Oracle Provider

```bash
repo-harness chatgpt browser-consult \
  --repo . \
  --provider oracle \
  --prompt "Review this PRD and return risks." \
  --file plans/prds/example.prd.md \
  --follow-up "Challenge your previous recommendation." \
  --write-output .ai/harness/handoff/chatgpt-review.md
```

The wrapper maps repo-harness input to `oracle --engine browser --browser-manual-login --browser-archive never`, passing an internal managed `--write-output` answer file. **The answer file plus the process terminal state are authoritative; stdout/stderr are treated as logs only** (used to detect the ChatGPT conversation URL and provider session ID, never as the answer). A clean exit that produces no answer file is reported as `recoverable` / `ORACLE_CAPTURE_INCOMPLETE` (the prompt may already be submitted — reattach with `browser-followup` rather than re-sending). All behavior is passed explicitly so `.oracle/config.json` defaults are never silently inherited.

The oracle binary is resolved in a fixed, auditable order — `--oracle-bin`, then `REPO_HARNESS_ORACLE_BIN`, then repo-local `node_modules/.bin/oracle`, then `oracle` on `PATH`. A missing binary fails with `ORACLE_NOT_INSTALLED`; explicitly configured binaries (`--oracle-bin` or `REPO_HARNESS_ORACLE_BIN`) fail closed when invalid and do not silently fall through to the next source. repo-harness never implicitly downloads or `npx`-executes an unpinned oracle. `browser-doctor --provider oracle --json` runs a `--help`/`--version` capability probe and reports `installed`, resolved `binary`, `version`, `nodeCompatible`, and a `capabilities` map (`browserEngine`, `manualLogin`, `writeOutput`, `browserFollowup`, `sessionFollowup`, `browserArchive`); `status:"ready"` requires every capability for every flag repo-harness may send at runtime.

Multi-turn works two ways: repeat `--follow-up` within one run, or reopen a saved conversation later with `browser-followup --session <id>` (which passes oracle `--followup <providerSessionId>`). A follow-up records the parent `providerSessionId` and only resumes from a session that reached a resumable terminal state.

The doctor status taxonomy is distinct per provider (no single overloaded `partial`): oracle → `ready` | `unavailable` (`ORACLE_NOT_INSTALLED`) | `action_required` (`ORACLE_INCOMPATIBLE`); native → `deprecated` (`NATIVE_PROVIDER_DEPRECATED`); bridge → `experimental` (`BRIDGE_EXPERIMENTAL`).

`--write-output` is validated by repo-harness before the provider runs. By default it must be repo-relative, must not target denied paths, and must not overwrite an existing file unless `--overwrite-output` is passed. Absolute output paths require the human-only `--allow-absolute-output` flag and are not available through MCP browser tools.

## Bridge Provider

```bash
repo-harness chatgpt browser-bind --repo . --open
repo-harness chatgpt browser-consult \
  --repo . \
  --provider bridge \
  --prompt "Reply exactly OK"
```

The bridge provider uses the generated unpacked Chrome extension in the user's selected profile. The extension is scoped to `https://chatgpt.com/*`, `https://chat.openai.com/*`, and the local bridge URL only. It does not request cookies or storage permissions. The extension polls localhost for one task, submits the prompt through the visible ChatGPT composer, waits for assistant text, and posts the result back to repo-harness.

The localhost bridge requires a per-binding capability token: `browser-bind` generates and persists `bridgeToken` in `.repo-harness/chatgpt-browser.local.json`, injects it into the generated extension, and the bridge server rejects any request whose `x-repo-harness-bridge-token` header does not match with `401`. Because the token is stable per binding, reload the unpacked extension once after upgrading. A server-side backstop also coerces any `completed` result whose output is empty or a status-only string (e.g. `Pro thinking`) into a `failed` / `CHATGPT_BRIDGE_NO_FINAL_MESSAGE`, so the DOM-scrape path can never persist a non-answer as success.

Bridge provider runs use the current model and thinking mode already selected in the ChatGPT Web UI. Passing `--model` or `--thinking` with `--provider bridge` fails closed with `BRIDGE_MODEL_SELECTION_UNSUPPORTED`; use the Oracle provider when provider-side model selection is required.

Failure is explicit:

- Missing extension connection reports `CHATGPT_BRIDGE_EXTENSION_NOT_CONNECTED`.
- Connected extension without task completion reports `CHATGPT_BRIDGE_RESULT_TIMEOUT` or `CHATGPT_BRIDGE_TASK_NOT_CLAIMED`.
- Page-side execution failure reports `CHATGPT_BRIDGE_TASK_FAILED`.
- Missing captured assistant text reports `CHATGPT_BRIDGE_CAPTURE_TIMEOUT`.

## Native Provider Spike

```bash
repo-harness chatgpt browser-doctor --repo . --provider native
repo-harness chatgpt browser-consult \
  --repo . \
  --provider native \
  --prompt "Reply exactly OK"
```

The native provider launches installed Google Chrome and drives it through a local Chrome DevTools Protocol websocket. It opens ChatGPT Web, waits for a visible composer, submits the assembled prompt, waits for an assistant response, and saves the captured text into the same repo-local session store.

Native provider consults require a bound ChatGPT product session in a non-default automation profile. Configure it with `browser-setup --profile-dir <dir>`, authorize it with `browser-bind --open`, or pass an explicit non-default `--profile-dir` for an ad hoc run. Existing default Chrome profiles should use `--provider bridge`. The saved binding also carries the Chrome channel and ChatGPT URL, so normal consult and follow-up commands do not need to repeat them.

Native provider runs use the current model and thinking mode already selected in the ChatGPT Web UI. Passing `--model` or `--thinking` with `--provider native` fails closed with `NATIVE_MODEL_SELECTION_UNSUPPORTED`; use the Oracle provider when provider-side model selection is required.

Failure is explicit:

- Missing Google Chrome reports `NATIVE_PROVIDER_FAILED` with the missing app path.
- Missing profile binding reports `NATIVE_PROFILE_NOT_BOUND`.
- Default Chrome data directory usage reports `NATIVE_DEFAULT_PROFILE_CDP_BLOCKED` / `blocked_default_profile`.
- Unsupported native model/thinking selection reports `NATIVE_MODEL_SELECTION_UNSUPPORTED`.
- Missing login or composer reports `LOGIN_OR_COMPOSER_NOT_READY`.
- A submitted run with no captured assistant text reports `ASSISTANT_CAPTURE_TIMEOUT`.
- A submitted run whose assistant text did not stabilize before timeout reports `ASSISTANT_CAPTURE_INCOMPLETE`.

For first login, run `browser-setup --profile-dir <non-default-dir>`, then `browser-bind --open`. Click **Bind ChatGPT**. If it reports login required, click **Open ChatGPT Login**, complete login, return to the authorization page, and click **Bind ChatGPT** again.

## Sessions

```bash
repo-harness chatgpt browser-list --repo .
repo-harness chatgpt browser-session --repo . chgpt_20260617_120530_review-sprint
repo-harness chatgpt browser-session --repo . chgpt_20260617_120530_review-sprint --metadata-only
repo-harness chatgpt browser-open --repo . chgpt_20260617_120530_review-sprint
```

Each session contains:

```text
.ai/harness/chatgpt/sessions/<sessionId>/
  meta.json
  prompt.md
  transcript.md
  output.md
  events.jsonl
  artifacts/
```

## Follow-Up Sessions

```bash
repo-harness chatgpt browser-followup \
  --repo . \
  --session chgpt_20260617_120530_review-sprint \
  --prompt "Turn that review into a Codex-ready goal."
```

Follow-up sessions are linked with `sourceSessionId` in `meta.json`. The Oracle provider receives `providerSessionId` from the source session as upstream provider context; it does not pass the repo-harness local `chgpt_...` session ID as an Oracle session. Dry-run follow-ups still write a linked local session without opening a browser.

## Cleanup

```bash
repo-harness chatgpt browser-cleanup --repo . --status dry_run --limit 20
repo-harness chatgpt browser-cleanup --repo . --status dry_run --limit 20 --force
```

Cleanup defaults to dry-run. It only removes candidates when `--force` is passed.

## MCP

Browser tools are disabled by default.

```bash
repo-harness mcp serve \
  --repo . \
  --transport stdio \
  --profile planner \
  --enable-chatgpt-browser
```

Enabled tools:

- `run_chatgpt_browser_consult`
- `read_chatgpt_browser_session`
- `list_chatgpt_browser_sessions`
- `open_chatgpt_browser_session`
- `continue_chatgpt_browser_session`

Use `dryRun: true` for planning or policy inspection. Non-dry-run consults may create a real ChatGPT Web conversation through the configured provider.

MCP browser consults restrict `writeOutput` to repo-harness workflow artifacts such as `.ai/harness/handoff/*.md`, `tasks/reviews/**`, `.ai/harness/checks/**`, `plans/prds/**`, and `plans/sprints/**`. Absolute paths, source paths, package manifests, lockfiles, secrets, and existing files without `overwriteOutput: true` are rejected before provider execution.

## File Policy

Allowed by default:

- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`
- `docs/**`
- `plans/**`
- `tasks/**`
- `.ai/context/**`
- `.ai/harness/**`
- `package.json`

Denied by default:

- `.env`, `.env.*`
- private key and certificate files
- `.ssh/**`, `.git/**`
- `node_modules/**`, `dist/**`, `build/**`, `coverage/**`
- `secrets/**`, `credentials/**`, `private/**`, `_ops/**`
- `.repo-harness/**/*.json`

The engine rejects denied files before browser/provider execution.
Allowed-path symlinks that resolve outside the repository are rejected.

## Security Notes

- Keep browser profiles and local config uncommitted.
- Prefer product-session binding over copying cookies or launching an unrelated fresh profile.
- Do not expose Chrome remote debugging outside localhost without an explicit tunnel/security plan.
- Use dry-run before sending large or sensitive context.
- Prefer narrow files over whole-repo dumps.
- Treat generated ChatGPT output as review input, not authoritative code truth.
