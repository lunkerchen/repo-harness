# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-05

### Changed

- Replaced the public `repo-harness init` path with a typed global bootstrap
  that installs the current package as the global CLI, refreshes repo-harness
  skill aliases, installs user-level hook adapters, configures Waza
  `think`/`hunt`/`check`/`health`, persists the brain root, and configures
  CodeGraph MCP without applying repo-local workflow files to the current
  directory.

### Removed

- Removed the Superpowers Claude marketplace installer path entirely from the
  active `repo-harness init` flow and from `scripts/setup-plugins.sh`.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- Streamed `repo-harness init` setup output directly to the terminal so the
  first-run `npx -y repo-harness init` path no longer looks hung while
  `setup-plugins.sh` clones skills or runs Claude plugin setup.
- Made the Superpowers Claude marketplace plugin opt-in via
  `repo-harness init --with-superpowers` instead of installing it by default.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added `repo-harness init` as a thin npm CLI wrapper around
  `scripts/setup-plugins.sh`, so users can run
  `npx -y repo-harness init` for first-run global Claude plugin and hook-profile
  bootstrap without cloning the source repository.
- Added a prompt-guard CodeGraph self-heal path: before emitting the first
  structural code-navigation hint in a session, a missing `.codegraph` index is
  initialized with the local or PATH-visible CodeGraph binary without running the
  heavier readiness probe.

### Changed

- Moved the existing repo-local harness install/refresh CLI surface to
  `repo-harness update`, keeping `repo-harness init` focused on global runtime
  initialization.
- Updated the English, Chinese, Japanese, French, and Spanish READMEs for the
  `0.2.1` npm release line and the split `init` / `update` lifecycle.

### Fixed

- Kept automatic hook-side CodeGraph initialization non-blocking and cleaned up
  the Cursor rule file if current CodeGraph created it only as a side effect of
  this automatic init.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added a read-only config security scan (`repo-harness security scan [--json]`) that checks high-value hook and editor-task config (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/hooks.json`, repo-local `.vscode/tasks.json`, and legacy project-level `.claude`/`.codex` adapters) for suspicious command patterns — remote-shell pipes, base64-decode-to-exec, `osascript`, `launchctl`/`crontab` persistence, netcat, and inline interpreter execution — plus unmanaged hook commands and auto-run `folderOpen` tasks. It reports findings only and never mutates config.
- Added a low-frequency `SessionStart` sentinel (`.ai/hooks/security-sentinel.sh`, wired into the `SessionStart.default` route) that fingerprints the config set and re-scans only when a fingerprint changes, surfacing a one-line `[SecurityConfig]` reminder when findings appear.
- Added a `security-config` check to `repo-harness doctor` backed by the same read-only scan.

### Changed

- Bumped the npm package release line from `0.1.5` to `0.2.0`; generated workflow compatibility stays on the `5.2.3` model line, and `repo-harness --version` / `repo-harness status` now report `0.2.0`.
- Added `Why repo-harness` and `What's New in 0.2.0` sections to the English, Chinese, Japanese, French, and Spanish READMEs, promoting file-backed cross-session coordination, CodeGraph-plus-progressive-context token savings, the `scripts/setup-plugins.sh` installer, the config security sentinel, and the Claude/Codex draft-plan lifecycle.
- Added the README hero image to the npm package allowlist so package consumers get the same visual surface as the source checkout.
- Fixed the Chinese README, which still referenced `0.1.4`, to track the current release version.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- Added `REPO_HARNESS_*` environment variable aliases for scaffold, migration, context-block selection, external-tooling checks, and contract-worktree controls while preserving `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_*` as legacy fallbacks.
- Switched new runtime `.gitignore` and Codex resume generated markers to `repo-harness` while keeping dual-read compatibility for legacy `project-initializer` markers.
- Added a dirty merged linked-worktree closeout guard to `ship-worktrees.sh --cleanup-merged`, requiring useful deltas to be committed, picked, or applied before cleanup and allowing only explicit scaffold-only discard.
- Made `prepare-codex-handoff.sh` prefer Node for global handoff file updates, with Python retained as a fallback, so release verification does not depend on the local `python3 -` execution path.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

- Switched generated plan task artifacts from slug-only names to the active plan stem (`YYYYMMDD-HHMM-<slug>`) for `tasks/contracts/`, `tasks/reviews/`, and `tasks/notes/`.

### Fixed

- Kept workflow-state, handoff, archive, and contract-worktree helpers compatible with existing slug-only task artifacts while preferring the new plan-stem paths.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Added AI-native scaffold profiles as overlays on the existing A-K plan catalog, including runtime-console, product-copilot, and sidecar-kernel project structures without introducing new public plan codes.
- Added AI-native template variables so selected profiles can project focused project structures, runtime-console defaults, and tech-stack guidance while ordinary A-K scaffolds stay unchanged.
- Added a typed prompt-guard decision engine behind `repo-harness-hook prompt-guard-decide`, keeping host adapters stable while making `intent x plan state` routing table-driven and testable.
- Added CLI and route-level regression coverage for the internal prompt-guard decision command, the lightweight hook entrypoint, and the public `UserPromptSubmit --route default` path through real hook assets.
- Added an optional deploy SQL invariant coverage check: when `tests/sql/control_plane_invariants.sql` exists, `check-deploy-sql-order.sh` now verifies every `deploy/sql/*.sql` migration is referenced by full path or basename.
- Added a dated release filing under `deploy/release-checklists/260531-repo-harness-0.1.3.md` and documented the `YYMMDD-<package>-<version>.md` filing rule.

### Changed

- Split prompt-guard responsibilities so shell continues to parse hook JSON, read workflow files, perform capture side effects, and render host-safe output while TypeScript owns the explicit decision table.
- Documented the 0.1.x release surface as `repo-harness@0.1.3`, still separate from the generated workflow compatibility line (`5.2.3`).
- Expanded the English and Chinese README plus the hook operations reference to show the current host adapter -> CLI route registry -> shell hook -> TypeScript decision table architecture.

### Fixed

- Routed active Draft plan prompts such as `implement this plan` and `执行这个方案` to the non-blocking PlanCaptureGate instead of hard-blocking under PlanStatusGuard.
- Routed no-active-plan and Approved-plan execution projection prompts through the appropriate capture/projection advice instead of collapsing them into generic PlanStatusGuard or ContractGuard failures.
- Treated copied worktree status, retrospective completion reports, and next-slice planning summaries as passive context so they do not start implementation gates merely because they quote implementation vocabulary.
- Ensured linked contract worktrees include `.ai/harness/planning/` before pending orchestration cleanup, preserving strict workflow verification in generated worktrees.
- Filtered `tasks/.current.md.tmp.*` refresh scratch files out of generated `tasks/current.md` snapshots, including generated repo helper parity.
- Aligned `repo-harness --version` and `repo-harness status` with the `package.json` release version for `0.1.3`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Added `repo-harness init` as a one-shot existing-repo bootstrap that defaults `--repo` to the current working directory, refreshes host adapters, applies the harness, installs Waza runtime skills, syncs `diagram-design`, and verifies the repo-local workflow.
- Added `repo-harness init --no-codegraph` and `--configure-codegraph` so existing-repo bootstrap can either skip CodeGraph readiness or explicitly register CodeGraph MCP after building the index.
- Added `check:release` / `prepublishOnly` npm release gates that check the official npm registry and reject already-published package versions before running tests, workflow checks, migration dry-run, and pack dry-run.
- Added a GitHub-facing bilingual README path with `README.zh-CN.md` and a Mermaid task workflow from plan to contract worktree checkout, guarded implementation, verification, review, external acceptance, finish, merge, and cleanup.

### Changed

- Retired `project-initializer` as a Codex/Claude installed skill path and upstream resolver fallback; installed-copy sync now removes those directories instead of maintaining them.
- Switched generated footer stamps to `repo-harness@...` while keeping `.claude/.skill-version` semantic version fields stable.
- Prepared npm publishing under the unscoped `repo-harness` package name, made `repo-harness` the primary installed command, and kept `repo-harness-skill` as a compatibility alias.
- Split the npm/CLI package release line (`0.1.x`) from the generated workflow compatibility line (`5.2.3`).
- Updated GitHub repository metadata and source checkout docs for the `Ancienttwo/repo-harness` rename.
- Forced copy-based installed-skill sync when `repo-harness init` runs from an npm `_npx` cache source, avoiding symlinks to temporary npx cache directories.
- Clarified the product boundary, three-layer operating model, and task lifecycle on the README landing page.

### Fixed

- Rebuilt Claude skill aliases during installed-copy sync so `~/.claude/skills/project-initializer` cannot remain on a stale legacy repo while Codex runtime aliases are current.
- Reduced full-suite release flakiness by giving `doctor` environment-probe tests a wider timeout budget.

## [5.2.3] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Expanded anchored approval intent variants such as `go ahead with it`, `please proceed`, and `可以干了` so post-plan approvals reach `PlanCaptureGate` / `PlanExecutionGate` without treating broad bug-fix wording as approval capture.

## [5.2.2] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Started a Draft `plans/` artifact as soon as explicit Codex Plan mode or Waza `/think` planning begins, so plan lifecycle state exists before approval and execution gates run.
- Let terse approval prompts such as `GO` and `可以干` reach the approved-plan capture/projection path instead of being blocked before the agent can run `capture-plan.sh` or `plan-to-todo.sh`.

## [5.2.1] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Fixed terse `GO` approval prompts after Codex Plan mode or Waza `/think` so they trigger `PlanStatusGuard` and route execution through captured `plans/` artifacts instead of bypassing the workflow gate.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Added passive plan capture so Codex Plan mode, Waza `/think`, and `repo-harness-plan` outputs can become file-backed `plans/plan-*.md` artifacts through `scripts/capture-plan.sh`, with approved captures able to project directly through `plan-to-todo.sh`.
- Added opt-in default-brain document mirroring through `scripts/sync-brain-docs.sh`, manifest `sync.direction=repo-to-brain` entries, and PostEdit hook integration for registered valuable docs.
- Promoted CodeGraph from advisory setup guidance to required Codex agent readiness for code navigation, with read-only detector support, strict readiness checks, generated repo `.codegraph/` ignores, and non-vendored host install guidance.

## [5.1.2] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Added generated Codex hook adapter support through `.codex/hooks.json` while keeping `.ai/hooks/` as the shared hook implementation layer.
- Updated init, scaffold, migration, workflow contract, docs, and tests so generated repos install both Claude and Codex hook adapters.

## [5.1.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Refreshed stale `references/` docs for the current `repo-harness` hook, migration, eval, plugin, and minimal-documentation contracts.
- Updated public-surface spec and architecture docs to reflect the full 13-command `agentic-dev-*` facade inventory.
- Removed empty optional doc placeholders so generated/self-hosted docs match the `minimal-agentic` profile.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Added filesystem-owned Evidence Contract fields and guards so approved plan execution must name state/progress path, verification evidence, evaluator rubric, stop condition, and rollback surface before implementation or completion.

### Changed

- Made broad research delegation a main-agent spawn decision based on context impact and callable runners, with bounded main-thread fallback when spawning is not useful or available.
- Hardened Waza external-tooling checks to compare whole skill directories and shared `rules/` files instead of only `SKILL.md`, catching broken `references/`, `scripts/`, `agents/`, and cross-skill rule links.

## [5.0.2] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- Excluded ignored repo-local runtime state from Codex installed-copy sync outputs.

## [5.0.1] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Added the repo-harness plugin architecture map, domain/module docs, and capability-indexed local context contracts for Claude and Codex.

### Fixed

- Fixed Codex installed-copy sync for symlinked legacy `project-initializer` fallback paths.
- Removed tracked Claude trace state from the release surface and ignored repo-local Codex/runtime logs.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- Made repeated `migrate-project-template.sh --apply` idempotent after a clean migration commit by normalizing first-write JSON output and preserving unchanged version stamps.
- Removed stale `3.1 guidance` wording from migration dry-run output.

### Changed

- Added `deploy/sql/` as the tracked deployment SQL surface and wired a filename-order check for `0001_name.sql` style files.
- Split deployable operations assets into tracked `deploy/` while keeping `_ops/` fully ignored for local private operations state and secrets.
- Externalized long-form optional reference configs into the default brain file vault while keeping repo-local runtime contracts, hooks, scripts, and required minimal docs authoritative.
- Added a repo-local brain manifest and workflow check for default brain pointers without making hooks depend on gbrain or iCloud.
- Renamed the skill/package/repo display surface to `repo-harness` while keeping `repo-harness-skill` and `project-initializer` as legacy aliases, install paths, and generated stamp compatibility surfaces.
- Added action-style `agentic-dev-*` command skill facades for plan, review, autoplan, init, scaffold, migrate, upgrade, repair, and check while keeping hooks/docs initialization internal.
- Added advisory prompt-hook route hints for reusable-workflow packaging, with `repo-harness-autoplan` handling evidence-first plans only after user authorization.
- Added a Codex installed-copy sync helper that keeps command facades only in the canonical `repo-harness` copy while legacy directories remain runtime fallback bundles.

## [4.0.2] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- Installed `inspect-project-state.ts`, `migrate-workflow-docs.ts`, `workflow-contract.ts`, `check-skill-version.ts`, and a delegating `migrate-project-template.sh` wrapper into generated repos so the router verification path is not left stale.
- Made generated capability discovery ignore `.worktrees/` and `_ref/` caches, preventing local worktree contracts from polluting `.ai/context/capabilities.json`.

## [4.0.1] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Added a versioned upgrade strategy to the workflow contract, inspector output, harness policy, and migration cleanup path so legacy reconfiguration, archives, preserves, and removals are auditable.
- Added `docs/reference-configs/global-working-rules.md` as the user-level Claude/Codex rule template with enforceable P1/P2/P3 due diligence.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-05-20

### Changed

- Removed `docs/PROGRESS.md` from default generated and required workflow surfaces; legacy progress files are now archived during migration instead of normalized in place.
- Replaced default root `specs/` scaffolding with `docs/spec.md`, `interfaces/`, and tests as the stable product/runtime truth surfaces.
- Promoted `_ops/` as the trackable operations workspace for runbooks, submission materials, release checklists, and helper scripts, while keeping `_ops/secrets/` and `_ops/env/.env*` ignored.
- Made `_ref/` an ignored external comparison cache and added hook guards that block product edits under `_ref/` and sensitive `_ops` env/secret paths.
- Updated workflow contracts, generated templates, reference docs, architecture index, and tests to use `tasks/workstreams/` for durable progress and `docs/CHANGELOG.md` for release history.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- Added `minimal-agentic` documentation generation so default scaffolds keep only required docs plus a small reference-config set, with `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_DOCUMENTATION_PROFILE=full` preserving the previous full docs surface.
- Added `docs/reference-configs/document-generation.md` to document required docs, on-demand docs, and the Agent-owned decision boundary.
- Added `lsp_profiles` metadata to policy and context maps so selected functional blocks can carry lightweight tooling hints without expanding root prompt context.
- Added `worktree_strategy` policy for conflict-triggered `codex/<task-slug>` worktrees, Waza `/check`-style validation, and merge-back to `main` without absorbing unrelated dirty changes.
- Added implementation notes as a task-local workflow artifact under `tasks/notes/`, with plan, contract, review, handoff, and archive integration.
- Added raw verification run snapshots under `.ai/harness/runs/` so `checks/latest.json` remains a pointer while durable evidence stays inspectable.

### Changed

- Updated scaffold, migration, init, ensure, workflow contract, and tests to install reference configs through the documentation profile instead of copying every reference doc by default.
- Changed init/migration external-tooling reports to skip update checks by default; set `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_CHECK_TOOLING_UPDATES=1` when an advisory run should also check upstream versions.
- Updated harness policy and reference docs to distinguish notes, evidence, promoted assets, and advisory memory instead of collapsing task-local decisions into long-term memory.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added machine-readable `agentic_development` routing so product discovery uses gstack `office-hours`, complex engineering plans use gstack `plan-eng-review`, design plans use gstack `plan-design-review`, and daily small/medium work uses Waza `/think`, `/hunt`, and `/check`.
- Added `docs/reference-configs/agentic-development-flow.md` to keep detailed gstack/Waza routing and P1/P2/P3 due-diligence triggers out of root prompts.
- Added plan and review template sections for selected route, routing reason, and P1/P2/P3 evidence.
- Added `scripts/select-agent-context-blocks.sh` as the functional-block selector hook for paired `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` generation, so Claude Code and Codex receive the same local module contract without inferring boundaries from broad layout globs.

### Changed

- Stopped generating repo-local `.claude/hooks/` shim scripts by default; `.ai/hooks/` is now the shared hook implementation layer and `.claude/settings.json` is the Claude adapter.
- Updated scaffold, migration, workflow contract, policy defaults, reference configs, and tests to keep self-host and generated repos aligned.
- Hardened workflow verification and legacy task migration around runtime contract parsing and partially migrated `tasks/todo.md` files.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Added Codex-first Waza policy metadata to the harness contract and generated repo policy defaults.
- Added host-aware Waza detection for real Claude/Codex skill paths, per-skill versions, symlink targets, staging drift, and upstream stale status.
- Added tests covering Claude staging symlinks, Codex independent runtime copies, read-only update checks, and Codex stale drift reporting.

### Changed

- Changed Waza `--check-updates` handling to compare upstream `tw93/Waza` raw `SKILL.md` hashes without running mutating `npx skills check`.
- Documented the Waza stage -> copy into Codex -> `cmp` verification workflow for generated and self-hosted harnesses.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-04-19

### Changed

- Removed repo-local Skill Factory and Claude auto-memory surfaces from the shared harness, migration path, and self-hosted repo.
- Added `scripts/check-agent-tooling.sh` plus generated `docs/reference-configs/external-tooling.md` so init and migrate flows can report gstack, Waza, and gbrain advisory status safely.
- Merged guidance-only `external_tooling` defaults into `.ai/harness/policy.json` during scaffold and migration without overwriting explicit repo overrides.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- Added progressive context and harness policy surfaces alongside the workflow contract manifest so generated repos keep root context stable while exposing deeper context on demand.
- Wrote directory-level `AGENTS.md` files to discoverable module paths like `apps/*/AGENTS.md` instead of the container roots.
- Stopped custom plan `K` from creating `apps/`, `packages/`, and `services/` unless the target repo already has real module directories there.
- Corrected `scripts/inspect-project-state.ts` routing so initialized repos with bundled Skill Factory assets still classify as `audit` instead of collapsing to `skill-factory`.
- Tightened `scripts/check-task-workflow.sh` so strict workflow verification now fails explicitly when no `node`, `bun`, or `python3` runtime is available to read the workflow contract.
- Extended `scripts/migrate-workflow-docs.ts` to normalize legacy `tasks/todo.md` content in partially migrated repos and preserve the prior checklist in `tasks/archive/legacy-tasks-todo.md`.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- Added `assets/workflow-contract.v1.json` as the single machine-readable workflow contract and installed `.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json` in generated and self-hosted repos.
- Introduced `scripts/inspect-project-state.ts` so routing starts from structured repo inspection instead of prompt-only branching.
- Added `scripts/migrate-workflow-docs.ts` to preserve and migrate legacy `docs/plan.md`, `docs/TODO.md`, and execution-log style `docs/PROGRESS.md`.
- Updated migration, scaffold, and workflow verification paths to consume the shared contract manifest and verify it after migration.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-29

### Changed

- Added `run_id` to trace events, verification reports, and task-state snapshots for tighter report correlation.
- Expanded harness defaults to five dimensions by adding recovery and state profiles to the initializer question pack and plan map.
- Added structured `failure_class` logging plus `scripts/summarize-failures.sh` for guard failure aggregation.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-25

### Changed

- Upgraded generated repositories from a tasks-first scaffold to a shared long-running harness model.
- Added `docs/spec.md`, `tasks/reviews/`, and `.ai/harness/{checks,handoff}` as first-class generated artifacts.
- Reworked hook behavior around artifact-aware execution gates, contract scope enforcement, structured checks, and mandatory handoff generation.
- Upgraded the initializer question pack to `v2` and added stack-aware orchestration, evaluation, and handoff defaults.
- Updated helper scripts, templates, CLAUDE/AGENTS routing output, and tests to the shared harness model.
